// Example of non-blocking code from the video

const nonBlocking = () => {
    // setTimeout is part of the JavaScript window/browser API, the counter is actually being run outside of our main thread
    setTimeout(console.log, 3000, 'Two');
};

console.log('One');

nonBlocking();

// Notice in the console log that Three logs immediately after One
// This is because setTimeout is not happening here! We're running that function on another process in the Browser API
console.log('Three');
